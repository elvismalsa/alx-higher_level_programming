# 0x07. Python

This project is about Test-driven development in python

## Python Test Cases

All the test files are inside the tests folder <br>
All the test files are text files (extension: .txt) <br>
All your tests are executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
All the modules have the documentation(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
And the functions documentation(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')

#### more info

A documentation is not a simple word, it's a real sentence explaining what's the purpose of th module,
class or method
its adviceble to work well on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
 – The Checker is checking for tests!
